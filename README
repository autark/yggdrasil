Yggdrasil attempts to be an temporal, relation-based object storage
system. It might not meet the expectations of production ready code
for some people, but it's under rapid development and its feature set
is nearing completion. The source code is in perl, but the server
exchanges information via XML to its clients, allowing development of
front-ends in the language of ones own choice.

The idea presented by Yggdrasil is one of immutability of data, where
anything entered into the system is stored forever.  There are some
exceptions made for legal reasons and for backup / restore of the
system, but outside of that, data entered into Yggdrasil can always be
retrieved.
