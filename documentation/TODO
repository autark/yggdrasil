* Rename the current DB layer "Storage"

* Move all SQL out beyond the Storage layer into the engines or a
   shared SQL library for engines that talk SQL.

* Clean up new() and get() routines, standardize on a semantic meaning
   of "new()".

* Fix inserts so that the previous "current value" (found where the
   key equals ours and the stop is zero) is updated to get stopped.
   Stop should be set to NOW().

* MetaInheritance, build proper support for inheritance.

* Provide a larger test suite.

* Rename "Entity" to "Class"?  The term just doesn't sit well.

* Set up a test database under Postgresql.
