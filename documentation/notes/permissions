* The outside world sees:
 - Users
 - Groups
   + Can a user be in several groups at once?

 - Entities
   + If you cannot *read* an entity *and* all parent entities,
     you cannot access the properties for the given entity.
 - Properties
   + Yggdrasil needs to verify access for the property, and read
     access for the entity as per above (with inheritance).

* All access is given to roles.

* Everything is a role.  A single user might be a role of one,
  but the user is mapped to a role.
